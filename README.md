# Predicting High-Price Homes in Ames, Iowa

This repository contains an academic classification and probability modeling project
using the Ames Housing dataset.

The goal of the project is to predict whether a home belongs to the high-price segment
(top 5% of sale prices) based on housing characteristics. The analysis applies dummy
variable encoding, Linear Probability Models (LPM), and Logistic Regression.

The project includes data preparation, model estimation, marginal effects analysis,
model comparison, and evaluation of classification performance.

The full analysis, including code, charts, and explanations, is presented in the HTML file.
